# Welcome to Bower

This is my first post using **Bower**, a static site generator written in Scheme!

Bower uses:
- Steel Scheme for scripting
- Rust for performance
- S-expressions for templates

## Features

Bower supports:
1. Markdown content
2. S-expression front matter
3. Customizable templates
4. Fast Rust-based parsing

Pretty cool, right?
